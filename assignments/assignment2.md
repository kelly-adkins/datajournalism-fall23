This data set is based on the [press release](https://github.com/shmcminn/datajournalism-fall23/blob/master/assignments/assignment2.md#make-your-own-datasets---group-or-individual:~:text=Make%20your%20own%20datasets%20%2D%20group%20or%20individual) assigned to this. 

# Story Research

Below is a breakdown of additional research on the proposed data story: [How Remote Work Affects Take-Home Pay & Individual Living Wages in D.C.](https://github.com/kelly-adkins/datajournalism-fall23/blob/main/assignments/assignment1.md#pitch)

## What has already been reported?

What makes this topic interesting is the fact there are so many conflicting assumptions made, like:

* remote workers receive less pay than their on-site counterparts, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/remote-jobs-face-lower-wages/#:~:text=Employers%20know%20people%20want%20remote,in%20exchange%20for%20lower%20pay.)
* remote workers receive [more pay](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/#:~:text=Remote%20workers%2C%20in%20comparison%2C%20make,highest%20average%20salary%20at%20%2480%2C000.) than their on-site counterparts, also according to Forbes, somehow
* remote work does not affect taxable income, according to the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-working-from-home-have-to-mean-a-lower-salary-11635699600) and [U.S. News](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/how-remote-work-could-affect-your-income-taxes#:~:text=Remote%20Work%20Doesn't%20Usually%20Affect%20Federal%20Income%20Taxes&text=Your%20employer%20would%20withhold%20taxes,office%20expenses%2C%E2%80%9D%20Herigstad%20says.)
* remote workers [cannot reduce](https://www.cnbc.com/select/remote-work-tax-tips/) their taxable income
* remote workers wages are negatively impacted by other state and income taxes, according to the [National Conference of State Legislatures](https://www.ncsl.org/fiscal/state-and-local-tax-considerations-of-remote-work-arrangements).

It seems that most of the news has been around how employers are using remote work to [incentivize](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/07/12/1110510488/lean-out-employees-are-accepting-lower-pay-in-order-to-work-remotely) lower wages, and how the [tech industry](https://hired.com/state-of-tech-salaries/2022/?utm_source=pr&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=(a-all)(l-all)(r-all)(2022-sots-prs-rls)) has been able to increase their wages by relying on remote work.

## What _hasnâ€™t_ already been reported?

Applying this question specifically to D.C.-based remote workers have yet to be done. Finding which tax policies are only applicable to remote workers in D.C. could be time consuming, but manageable.

Also, a breakdown of how many remote workers in D.C. are part-time, full-time, or contracted could be beneficial. 

Finally, there is nothing that specifically documents how take-home pay is impacted by remote work. In industries such as technology and engineering, take-home pay is substantially different than their documented salary. This is because it is not always the "cash" offering other industries are used to; their salary also consists of stock options and other fluxuating income measures. There is some coverage on the business-side and how the [wage jockeying](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3666740/remote-work-spurs-a-national-wage-leveling-in-tech.html) has been popping up, but does not get into how it directly impacts workers.

## Accessible Data Sets

| Source | Available Data | Trustworthiness | Limitations |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Bureau of Labor Statistics | CPI Inflation Calculator; Census of Wages & Salary per year and per quarter | High trust due to the Bureau's prestige and standard. | There is not a breakdown specific to remote workers. Further analysis would be required |
| [Gusto](https://gusto.com/company-news/remote-hiring-brings-jobs-and-higher-pay-to-small-and-medium-cities-across-the-us) | Cross-State Hiring; Remote Worker Median Salary to On-Site Comparison; Related Demographics | The specific methodology and record of this analysis is accessible to the public. The transparency increases reputability. However, Gusto is an economic data tool that is somewhat lesser-known as an organization. | The assumptions of this data can be negated by other studies, which is a large limitation in the ability of use. | 
| [Hired](https://hired.com/state-of-tech-salaries/2022/?utm_source=pr&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=(a-all)(l-all)(r-all)(2022-sots-prs-rls)) | 2022 State of Tech Salaries | Hired is a known recruiting company, but it is unclear of what their in-house scraping/polling methodology is. | This report is specific to the tech industry, only. Although there is a large tech population in D.C., it is very limited. | 
| [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w30197) | Data associated with U.S. wage growth, and the wage-setting behavior of companies | High trust level due to scholarly nature and transparency of methodology | Because of the academic nature, this is a big-picture look of how remote work and wage growth intersect on the national level. There is little assumption about the individual fields and state policy that could contribute to this |

## Other Thoughts

In order to make this more digestable and newsworthy, I am wondering if homing in a handful of specific industries will be most helpful. Perhaps by finding which industries report the most remote workers in D.C., and those with the fewest. Or, this could just be an additional visualization to establish a baseline.
