# Data Reporting Critique

Below is my critique of [Bloomberg’s Where $521 Billion in U.S. Small-Business Aid Went](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-ppp-loans-data-disclosure/)

## Clarity and accuracy

Central Insight – 3.5
* Headline is only good if you are in the know. The lede and nut graf pair well together. That is where most of the insight is. 

Data visualization – 3.9 
* I wish the first map visualization was pushed below the nut graf. It is strange not really being sure what you are looking at contextually. 
* There was helpful and creative navigation assistance (see creativity rating below for more) that increased the ease-of-use and made the data breakdowns more digestible. 
* There was a lot of important information and data here, and I like that there are two separate visualizations with opposing chart types.
* There is not enough context for readers to understand why it is beneficial to look at a state-by-state breakdown, or the correlation between the states and the congressional districts. Also, when you click on the state view, it is not as intuitive as it could be to zoom back out. I would like a dropdown that goes back to the full map. I wanted to give this a 4, but it is not quite there for me.

Data accuracy – 4
* There is a strong presence of data attribution, including sourcing from the SBA, Census Bureau data, and published work from the University of Chicago and MIT. 
* There is also high transparency in any incomplete data or points that could be misinterpreted without context. For example, the explanations of the gaps in reported data available to source from the SBA, exceptions for certain underrepresented industries and non-employers. 
* What I am questioning is, was there an opportunity to FOIA for the missing data? If so, could this have been mentioned that Bloomberg News has requested for the information?

Side note: This is an interesting piece because they are now addressing stolen funds from the PPPs and COVID EIDLs, and the data still stands alone for the most part. 

## Quality

Quality – 3.5
* There is an error in the first map visualization. “% Jobs Retained” is listed as an explained field in the note, but the actual interactive uses the language “% Jobs Supported” which is, in itself, a more confusing way to identify the concept. This is especially vague since the map is placed above the nut graf, which explains that the retention rate is what will forgive the loan. 
* Although this is the only true error I found, in my opinion it is careless enough to knock what would have been a 4.8 quality to a 3.5. The reporting was balanced, the story stood alone quite well and the explanations were both detailed and digestible. 

## Type and color

(typography, fonts, colors, does it belong? Did you eye go to the most important?)
(type, 1-5; color, 1-5)

Type  – 4.5
Color – 4.5
* The use of yellow and blue were helpful because they are relatively neutral colors and not too demanding. Harsher colors such as red or green would have (1) skewed the narrative due to the implicit correlation to bad and good and (2) distracted the reader from the necessary written information. 
* I do think the shading of the colors was a little confusing. I am not sure that the value of the percentages was explained enough to emphasize the importance of this breakdown. 
* The state labels on the map are a perfect size and text, in my opinion, given how overwhelming the shading is. 
* The industry chart is well spaced with key identifiers, and uses color just sparingly enough. I would be interested to see more blue for the job retention in here, perhaps. 

## Creativity

Category Rating – 4
* This could have been a very boring and hard-to-navigate data set. Kudos to the reporters for making a lot of data into sense for people who – quite frankly – do not care where it came from. 
* The navigation graphic on the map (arrow, click, arrow) is a creative way to make the UI easy and know it is interactive.
* The use of extra drop-downs, buttons, and hovers on the map make it exciting to use.
* Not really sure if this is industry standard, but I really appreciate the use of brevity in explaining the data (notes, in the body, and the methodology breakdown). 

# Pitch 

The Washington Post reported that over a third of D.C. residents worked from home in 2022. While this is a decline since 2021, this data will serve as a more reliable baseline in the post-pandemic years to come. This employment style affects an individual’s take-home pay with less options to reduce taxable income. How does the increase in work-from-home jobs in D.C. affect the living wage?

## Available Data

There have been quite a few stories and investigations done on commute times and remote work post-pandemic. Taking this data to apply it here would be relatively simple, but finding corollaries would be substantially more difficult since there are so many variables at play (see Other Relevant Information for more). 

Data points I would be interested in acquiring include: per capita income, national income, income tax, property taxes.

| Organization | Type of Data | Recent Reporting |
|-—-|-–-|-–-| 
| D.C. Policy Center | Original Research | Study on gap in reported D.C. employees, post-pandemic (see below for more) |
| NPR | Sourced from Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments | Exportable .csv | 
| Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments | Survey | In correlation to commute times, downloadable PDF in NPR story | 
| Census Data | Original Data | Track household size?|

## Timeliness

Inflation is affecting all Americans, regardless of working location. Even with the Federal Reserve predicting a break, there may not be an immediate stress release without stabilization of the neutral interest rate, and it is highly likely there will be a recession within a year. A story on how many residents in the greater WMA area are unknowingly decreasing their salary could alleviate future stress.

## Potential Sources – Official
* Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Policy OR Housing, Transportation, and Community development
* Senate Finance Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight
* Senate Joint Committee on Taxation
* Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship – specifically to find any other regulations or taxes for self-employed individuals with a business listed in D.C. 
* (To those above) Related subcommittees of the House

## Potential Sources – Non-Official

* Work-from-home individuals
* Commuters from the greater WMA
* Employers with high WFH percentages

## Other Relevant Information

There are a lot of relevant data sets that could correlate to living wage. For example, recently, the D.C. Policy Center research showed, post-pandemic, a decrease in workers who reported D.C. as their place of work. Specifically, there is a large gap between the number of people who work in D.C. and this number reported by employers. What has yet to be found is if this correlation is a result of shorter distances, shorter commutes, relocation or increased work-from-home employees. Could there be a story of tax evasion here? Or, how might the living wage be affected by decreased commute times (i.e.: gas prices, car registration in neighboring states)? *Virginia has a property tax on the value of a registered car, which could be an increased variable cost to a living expense.* I also would be interested in how to track IRS documentation of state-based tax evasions, although most of that data will be private.
