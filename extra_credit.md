# Adding a data viz to Bloomberg

Bloomberg reported on the new motion-gesture Ai Pin by Humane Inc. Read about the [story](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-09/the-humane-ai-pin-launches-its-campaign-to-replaces-phones?cmpid=BBD112723_TECH&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=231127&utm_campaign=tech#xj4y7vzkg) for more details.

## My data viz

I made this dot plot in Datawrapper, then transferred to Illustrator to add the numbers per dot and show that the Ai Pin and Apple Watch Series 9 (Stainless Steal) were the same price. 

I chose a dot plot, because a bar or column graph did not show the difference in comparison from one product to the next. I wanted the stacked feel for the Pin and Series 9. 

## How I got my data

Check out my [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ewe2BncFSj3b19Fcz1eVqpz2j2njuLnqUuohbOAtkns/edit?usp=sharing). 

I received this story via a Bloomberg newsletter, which offered an opinion comparison of the Ai Pin to other motion-sensor tech both on the market and retired from life cycle. That is what led me to compare the price of this novel product to a few of the ones mentioned in the opinion. You can take a look at the newsletter, below.

I gathered each price from the newest models from the brand's website, and was sure to cross-reference the full sale price for any Black Friday/holiday deals going on this week for accuracy.
